Hi, I am a research associate at the Indian School of Business. I am very new to GitHub :)
This folder contains some of my codes for data cleaning, regression, and spatial analysis. 
All codes are stata .do files. You will also file SQL codes with the extension .sql, while the rest are .docx files. 
I had been writing the documents as part of a group project. Please feel free to reach out to me if you feel anything can be improved!
